		<h1>Monica Alexander</h1>
		<div class="personal-statement">
			<p>I am a first-year PhD candidate in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.demog.berkeley.edu/">Demography Department</a> at the University of California, Berkeley. I am interested in applications of statistics to social issues such as maternity, migration and economic outcomes. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I work at the ANU's <a target="_blank" href="http://caepr.anu.edu.au/">Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research</a>, and as a research assistant. In the past I worked at the Reserve Bank of Australia.
			</p>
			<p>
			Outside of work and study I am interested in photography (the background photograph is of my hometown, Hobart, Australia) and music.
